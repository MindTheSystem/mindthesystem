          “How did we arrive at that decision? Should a different mix of people
          be involved, or involved in a different way? Should we change how we
          analyse opportunities before making similar decisions in the future?
          How do the incentives we have in place affect our decision-making?
          Should they be changed?”

        title: Growth alongside consulting
        content: >
          Tackling complex challenges is an on-going, infinite game. There is no
          “end-state” at community-building, education, social services or
          economic development; only constant improvements and pivots.
          Consultants who pop in and out might improve certain project outcomes,
          but your people, who grapple with the challenge on a daily basis, will
          determine how effective you are going to be. So even as we consult on
          your project, we focus not just on the solution but also on training
          your people’s mindset, instinct and behaviours in the process.

      - title: Our 4 systems approach
        subtitle: "Complex challenges fall outside any one person’s or organisation’s ability to define,\_predict and control."
        content: >
          The key tool of affecting systems change is not command and control,
          but rather influence. But it is possible to make systematic progress,
          as long as we mind the system of decision-making.


          Through years of practical experience, we have broken down the
          approach to complex problems into 4 systems:


          *   System 1: Future Operating Environment. What would our reality
          look like in the future; what are we solving towards?

          *   System 2: Stakeholders. Who is or needs to be involved, and how?

          *   System 3: Purpose. How do we agree on the new future, and take
          steps towards it?

          *   System 4: The Self. How am I prepared to guide this problem
          solving and change?
