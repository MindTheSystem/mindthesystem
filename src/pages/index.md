      # “


      At Pixar, \[Ed] Catmull probed both systems and processes, after both wins
      and stumbles. How should the feedback process, for example, be adjusted so
      a director is given the most valuable possible input, in a form most
      likely to be well received?...Catmull saw his job as minding the system
      rather than managing the projects.

          “How did we arrive at that decision? Should a different mix of people
          be involved, or involved in a different way? Should we change how we
          analyse opportunities before making similar decisions in the future?
          How do the incentives we have in place affect our decision-making?
          Should they be changed?”

        title: Growth alongside consulting
        content: >
          Tackling complex challenges is an on-going, infinite game. There is no
          “end-state” at community-building, education, social services or
          economic development; only constant improvements and pivots.
          Consultants who pop in and out might improve certain project outcomes,
          but your people, who grapple with the challenge on a daily basis, will
          determine how effective you are going to be. So even as we consult on
          your project, we focus not just on the solution but also on training
          your people’s mindset, instinct and behaviours in the process.

        subtitle: >-
          Affecting systems change is not about command and control, but rather
          influence. It is possible to make systematic progress, as long as we
          mind the system of decision-making.
        content: "Through years of practical experience, we have broken down the approach to complex problems into 4 systems:\n\n\_\_\_‎▶ **System 1:** Future Operating Environment. What would our reality look like in the future; what are we solving towards?\n\n\_\_\_‎▶︎️ **System 2:** Stakeholders. Who is or needs to be involved, and how?\n\n\_\_\_▶︎️ **System 3:** Purpose. How do we agree on the new future, and take steps towards it?\n\n\_\_\_▶︎️ **System 4:** The Self. How am I prepared to guide this problem solving and change?\n"
