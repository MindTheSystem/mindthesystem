      - title: What is a complex systems challenge?
        content: >
          Complex problems:


          *   Face constantly evolving environments

          *   Are hard to define, and the desired outcomes equally hard to pin
          down

          *   Cannot be addressed by one single solution, but rather require an
          infinite mindset of constant improvement of multiple solutions over
          time

          *   Involve multiple stakeholders who might hold conflicting
          perspectives and values


          *Such challenges fall outside any one person’s or organisation’s
          ability to define, predict and control.*


          Improving access to social services, addressing recycling rates,
          encouraging take up of public transport, safeguarding heritage, are
          all examples of complex problems – or in fact, pretty much any area of
          government that requires the politics, the policies, the service
          delivery, citizens and communities to be aligned.


          But complex systems are not limited to the ambit of governments;
          business models are evolving towards ecosystems, which require new
          alliances, strategies and leadership practices (see [Thinkers50
          report](https://thinkers50.com/thinkers50-books/ecosystems-inc/)).


          The key tension in solving complex problems is between forward
          momentum and space for emergence. People, in wanting fast answers,
          often default to the most obvious solution or tick-the-box mentality.
          This does not solve complex problems.


          In complex problems there are different perspectives and conflicting
          goals and unseen causal relationships. Complex problem-solving hence
          require us to hold the space for discovery. The key tool of affecting
          systems change is not command and control, but rather influence.


          But it is possible to make systematic progress, as long as we mind the
          system of decision-making.

          We help you break down the key drivers in your operating environment,
          and develop potential scenarios as a reality check.

          #### Who is or needs to be involved, and how? 


          —


          We help you identify your key stakeholders, their relationships and
          interactions as a system, and their roles in the value chain. This
          helps us be systematic in setting up the governance process of
          problem-solving: who is in the core decision-making team, who should
          be co-opted as strategic contributors or partners, and at which stage
          of the process.

          We help you and your stakeholders develop a collective vision that can
          inspire action, and design a set of experiments to learn about
          possible interventions before you scale them.
